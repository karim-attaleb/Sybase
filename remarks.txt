I am a newly recruited dba/data Engineer.
I need to comment on the very long document.
My aim is to build a unified data platform with all the mature industry components. 
It would a lake house architecture.
I want to build a system with composable and open standard components.
Can you help me write a summary that would respond to the long document?
Try and find issues in the document.
The response should be clear and propose a roadmap towards a lake house.
