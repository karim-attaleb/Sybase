I want to prepare a presentation to my team about a Unified Data Platform.
The Data platform should be made out of orthogonal composable systems with clear semantics and interface.
I want to define a clear taxonomy of the different constituent parts of a lake house.
We really want to have a grammar of the lake house.
We should clearly state our intent, what are we trying to achieve with a lake house.
The following elements should be part of the solution....
Storage
Open Table Format and ACID capabilities
Unified governance across all objects in the data platform.
Catalog
Query Engine
